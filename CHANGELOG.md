# Changelog

## Unreleased — 2026-07-19

- Adopted the V2 multi-repository architecture: created and scaffolded
  sibling repositories `market-system-contracts`, `market-intelligence-mcp`,
  and `trade-guard-mcp`. See `docs/ROADMAP.md` "V2 multi-repository
  expansion" for their status and `README.md` "Related repositories".
- Added `.gitignore` (none existed before) excluding `.scratch/`, `build/`,
  `.venv/`, and other local artifacts.
- Reworded `NOTICE`, `LEGAL_NOTICE.md`, and `docs/ROADMAP.md`: live trading
  is a real, intended goal of the overall Smart Dynamic Hedge system,
  provided exclusively through the separate `trade-guard-mcp` repository —
  previous wording read as if live trading were unintended or merely a
  downstream fork's concern, which was not accurate to the project's actual
  direction.
- Documented the language/dependency-minimization decision for this
  repository in `docs/ROADMAP.md` "Language and dependency policy": keep
  the existing tested C++ deterministic core as-is; the Python
  orchestration layer is a migration candidate to Rust (not started) so the
  whole system eventually shares one toolchain and one dependency/testing
  policy with the two Rust sibling repositories.
- No source code in `cpp/` or `python/` changed this entry — this is a
  documentation/repository-structure changelog entry only.
